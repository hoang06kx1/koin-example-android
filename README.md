> Just another endless surveys...

This is an demo appliation demonstrating how a good coverting test could help you in writing less error-prone code.
Totally written in Kotlin. (**Java**? sorry, I'm tired of null check)

## Tools
 - DI: Koin (*should stick back to Dagger2..explain below*)
 - Viewpager2 
 - Circle indicator
 - Android Architecture Components (*LiveData, Viewmodel*)
 - Retrofit, OkHttp, Glide
 - RxJava, RxBinding, RxAndroid
 - Leak canavary (*for auto detecting leaks*)
 - Customactivityoncrash (*let's give user a bug when their app crash instead of boring messages*)
 - Toasty (*more fancy Toast*)
 
 ## Test
 - AndroidX Test (*Deserve to be the next big thing in Anroid developers struggle life, I believe*)
 - Espresso 
 - Robolectric 
 - Specially thanks to: [**Kluent**](https://github.com/MarkusAmshove/Kluent) and [**Barista**](https://github.com/SchibstedSpain/Barista) - *the guy who serve great Espresso* saved me from nightmare of **Hamcrest**
